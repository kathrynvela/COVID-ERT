# COVID-ERT

This website was built by Kathryn Vela, MLIS for the Evidence Synthesis Program in Portland, Oregon. The purpose of the website is to curate links to rapid reviews on topics related to COVID-19 for quick and easy access by researchers in the U.S. and around the world.

The website is updated three times per week with newly released reviews to keep the content relevant and accessible.
